1. The original program prompts the user for two valid integers. It checks if the inputs are valid then checks if the first number is even or odd, if the number is odd it will add the second number to the product. Then, it will divide the first number by two and multiply the second number by two. It will repeat this process until the first number equals zero.
2. Only the project file is from my original solution, everything else I had to translate and change into functions.
3. The functions file, and the testing functions file are part of the converted solutions.
4. Some of the challenges that I had was the syntax. Going back and forth between the projects I would get confused as to why my program was not running correctly. 
5. I think that Python is better suited for this task because the syntax is easier to get down, and defining functions are a lot easier.
