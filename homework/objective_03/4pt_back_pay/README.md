# CPTR 142: Objective #4 (4 point)

## Problem Overview

In this homework you will write a program that uses constants, collects user input and formats the output.

## Scenario

Workers at a particular company have won a 7.6% pay increase retroactive for up to six months depending on their time with company.

1. In particular, you must use the following C++ keywords at least once in your program:

    * The `const` keyword

1. Output must format dollars to two decimal places.

1. You must format your code using the "Format Document" command in your development environment.

1. The program **must** produce output exactly as shown below, assuming that the given amounts are entered.

```html
Enter current annual salary: 100000
Enter number of months for back pay: 6

I'll return new annual salary, monthly salary, and retroactive pay.
