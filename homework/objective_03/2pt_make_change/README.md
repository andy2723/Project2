# CPTR 142: Objective #4 (2 point)

## Problem Overview

In this homework assignment you will collect decimal input and make calculations using division and the remainder.

## Scenario

You have been hired by a mathematically disinclined friend to write a program to help make change.
The program should accept the cost of an item and the amount paid, both in decimal form, and then provide the number of $20 bills, $10 bills, $5 bills, $1 bills, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies that should be returned as change.

## Solution Specifications

Your solution to this problem must meet the following criteria.

1. You must use floating-point variables to accept your inputs.

1. You must return the fewest pieces of money possible to make correct change.
   For example, if your change is $0.50, you should return two quarters, not five dimes.

1. You must format your code using the "Format Document" command in your development environment.

1. The program **must** produce output exactly as shown below, assuming that the given amounts are entered.
   Note that the dollar signs ($) are part of the program prompt -- they are not entered by the user.

```html
Enter the cost in dollars and cents: $13.59
Enter the amount paid in dollars and cents: $45.00

Your change is:
  - twenty-dollar bills: 1
  - ten-dollar bills: 1
  - five-dollar bills: 0
  - one-dollar bills: 1
  - quarters: 1
  - dimes: 1
  - nickels: 1
  - pennies: 1
```
